            <h2>Hi, I'm Rohit 👋</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Content Lead at Caldera, a leading Rollup-as-a-Service platform backed by Sequoia and Founders Fund. I write about blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and the future of decentralized systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background includes roles at InfStones and Figment, two major EigenLayer node operators, where I developed deep expertise in blockchain infrastructure and operator economics. I'm currently completing my Applied Statistics degree at the University of Toronto while working full-time.

            <h2>Canvas Protocol Demo</h2>
            <p>
                This site also serves as a demonstration of Canvas Protocol, a blockchain-based marketplace that transforms CAPTCHAs from user friction into monetizable advertising inventory.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you first visited this site, you completed an interactive CAPTCHA verification. This proves you're human while allowing publishers to earn revenue from the verification process. It's a win-win: better user experience and sustainable monetization for content creators.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learn more about Canvas Protocol and how it's building the future of verifiable human attention at <a href="https://canvas-protocol.xyz" style="color: #667eea;">canvas-protocol.xyz</a>
