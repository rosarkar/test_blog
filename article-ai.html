                Large language models have evolved from chatbots to autonomous agents capable of complex workflows. This transformation is fundamentally changing how enterprises approach software development and business process automation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google are racing to build agent frameworks that can execute multi-step tasks, make decisions, and interact with external tools. The implications for enterprise software are profound: routine tasks that once required human oversight can now be delegated to AI agents.
            </p>

            <h2>From Chatbots to Agents</h2>

            <p>
                The key difference between traditional chatbots and modern AI agents is autonomy. While chatbots respond to prompts, agents can break down complex goals into subtasks, use tools to gather information, and execute actions with minimal human intervention.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "We're moving from AI as a copilot to AI as a colleague. Agents don't just assist; they independently complete entire workflows." - Dario Amodei, Anthropic
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This shift is enabled by improvements in reasoning capabilities, better tool use, and more reliable long-term planning. Models can now maintain context across dozens of steps and recover gracefully from errors.
            </p>

            <h2>Enterprise Use Cases</h2>

            <p>
                Early adopters are deploying AI agents for customer support, data analysis, software development, and business intelligence. The results are impressive: reduced response times, improved accuracy, and significant cost savings.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, challenges remain around reliability, security, and integration with existing systems. As the technology matures, we'll see more standardized frameworks and best practices emerge for deploying agents safely in production environments.
