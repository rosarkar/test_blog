                Decentralized finance has matured significantly over the past few years, moving from an experimental niche to a legitimate alternative to traditional financial services. But challenges around user experience, regulation, and security remain.
            </p>

            <h2>What's Working</h2>

            <p>
                DeFi protocols handling lending, borrowing, and trading have proven their resilience. Platforms like Aave, Uniswap, and Compound process billions in transactions with minimal downtime. The composability of these protocols - the ability to build new financial products by combining existing ones - has enabled rapid innovation.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "DeFi's killer app isn't a single protocol; it's the ability to compose financial services like Lego blocks." - Stani Kulechov, Aave
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Real-world asset tokenization is gaining traction, with traditional financial instruments moving onchain. This bridge between TradFi and DeFi could unlock trillions in capital.
            </p>

            <h2>Remaining Challenges</h2>

            <p>
                User experience remains the biggest barrier to mainstream adoption. Managing private keys, understanding gas fees, and navigating complex interfaces deter non-technical users. Account abstraction and improved wallet UX are helping, but there's still work to do.
            </p>

            <p>
                Regulatory uncertainty persists, with different jurisdictions taking varying approaches. Clear frameworks that protect users without stifling innovation are needed for DeFi to reach its full potential.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite these challenges, DeFi's value proposition - open access, transparency, and programmability - continues to attract developers and users. The next phase of growth will come from solving UX and regulatory challenges while maintaining the decentralized ethos.
